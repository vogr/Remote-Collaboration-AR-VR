# Remote Cross-platform Collaboration between AR and VR

## Goal

Develop an expandable framework connecting AR and VR into a common, virtual
collaboration space.

## Description

The aim of this project is to come up with a Unity framework being able to
connect a user in VR to a user in AR. You will be using a Hololens 2 and an HTC
Vive Pro and test how the two systems can be brought together into a common
virtual space. Besides the initial connection, you establish a voice chat
functionality and synchronize the motion of both users such that they can see
each other (simple hand and head poses are sufficient). Here, the HTC comes
with two controllers usable as hands, the Hololens comes with an optical hand
tracking service.

In a second step, you implement a simple task (to be defined in the project
based on your progress) which the two users need to fulfill together, however
with the catch of one-sided information distribution. This means that only one
user has access to information on how to complete the task, whereas the other
needs to perform. The overall task consists of two rounds, for each round, one
user will lead and direct the other using voice chat and their hands, before
they switch roles.
